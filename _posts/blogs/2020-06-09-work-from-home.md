### The working from home tech movement is upon us

---

I have been working from home for the past 3 months. After a short adjustment period, it has actually been pretty great. I have now started becoming concerned about even returning to the office. I love my new office at home. I get to spend time with my Wife and dog. I get to have better lunches without paying a dining out premium. And the commute is the greatest part.

So why would I ever want that to end? My company has been really awesome about allowing us to work from home during the crisis. As I see many tech companies beginning to offer permanent work from home, I feel like it will be an industry shift. If/when my company offers WFH as a permanent work-type, I will definitely take it.

### Both Employees and Employers Save Money

---

Employees can save a lot of dough by working from home. In fact, it is estimated that employees can save between [<ins>$2500.00 - $4000.00 per year</ins>](https://globalworkplaceanalytics.com/telecommuting-statistics). That is money saved from commuting costs, food (the dining out premium I mentioned above), parking, and etc.

Employees aren't the only ones that can benefit from WFH policies. Employers can save a lot of money too. Less employees in the office means less need for square footage, less office supplies, and money saved. According to Global Workplace Analytics, Employers can save an estimated average of [<ins>$11,000.00 per half-time telecommuter</ins>](https://globalworkplaceanalytics.com/telecommuting-statistics).

That's a lot of money. Combine that with the recruitment boost that the offer of WFH brings to a company and it seems like a clear decision.

But won't employees working from home just skip the work part and watch Netflix all day????

Not so much as it turns out. Part of the above $11,000.00 figure includes a 15% increase in productivity from employees. Personally, I feel like I can get more work done from home than in the office. I don't start the day off with a mental burn from my commute which seems to help out a lot. I also get to have a less frantic morning usually taking my time to get a good breakfast in before work starts.

### Other Benefits

---

I think the majority of programmers are happier working from home. Anecdotally, the workplace surveys of satisfaction at my company are extremely high since the shift. Also though, I think employers could keep the benefits of WFH and not force it on everyone. By offering WFH as an option, those who do well will take the opportunity and those who prefer the office can stay there.

WFH can also benefit society by cutting down travel emissions. Less people commuting to work = less emissions. It also keeps the traffic light for everyone else. Who doesn't want to get behind the end of traffic jams? At a time where the climate is heating, it makes a lot of sense to cut down where we can.

### Conclusion

Working from home benefits employees, employers, and society. Companies and individuals can save a lot of money by WFH, and productivity will surprisingly go up. WFH can be used as a valuable recruitment tool as the popularity of WFH increases. Finally, WFH can help to benefit society by cutting down emissions.
