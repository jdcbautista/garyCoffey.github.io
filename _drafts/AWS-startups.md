### Introduction

---

When most people think of Amazon, they most likely think about online shopping and 2-day shipping. It is what they are best known for. And it is a great service. If it's not 2-day shipping that comes to mind, it could be Prime video/music, Kindle books, or even Alexa and other smart home tech. Amazon is a very large and diverse company. Bezos didn't become so rich by just offering 2-day shipping. One product that may only be familiar to developers however is AWS.

Just like Amazon has a diverse "civilian" product offering, they also serve a Swiss Army Knife of products to developers via the AWS umbrella. It's doubtful even an AWS dev even has a complete grasp on the breadth of products they offer.

* You want hosting?................ They have it.
* You want CI/CD?.................. They have it.
* You need a domain name?.......... ✅
* You want data storage?........... They have it.
* You want authentication?......... They have it.
* You want serverless applications? ✅
* You need some APIs?.............. Done.
* You need user management?........ They have that too.
* You want code versioning?........ I mean.. they have it. But why not Github?

In fact, they offer so many easy-to-use products, I see them being the future of development and definitely the right product for any startup. The products they offer also remove a lot of headache for companies/developers through freebies that are baked into the product itself. AWS also has thorough documentation, making those products easy for developers to learn. All of this comes with easy on the wallet pricing and scalability by design.
