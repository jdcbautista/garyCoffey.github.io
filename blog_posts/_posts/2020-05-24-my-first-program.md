It's hard to say where I began with software engineering. My first introduction to code was during my time in the Air Force.

While working as a *Linux System Admin*, my collegue decided to write a script to make our jobs easier. One of our tasks involved comparing flight data figures to set limits. If the data exceeded the limits in some way the ðŸ’£er would possibly have to receive special maintenance.

This was a terrible task to do manually as it was difficult to retrieve all of the data, and then you would have to do some complicated math for certain parts.
