### Welcome!
Welcome to the site! Thank you for visiting. My name is Gary Coffey. I created this site to showcase some of my favorite coding projects as well as to write various blogs. I figured I would use this page to talk about myself (career/hobbies/etc).

### Career

**Software Engineering**

**Air Force**

### Media Attention

I was recognized [here](https://www.codeplatoon.org/gary-coffey-and-karin-matsuyama-alumni-of-the-month-october-2019/) as the Code Platoon Member of the Month.

Shortly after graduating from Code Platoon, CBS news Chicago reached out interested in doing a news piece about under-employed veterans. You can see the full news post [here](https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2019/09/02/code-platoon-veterans-computer-coding/).

The company that I currently work for was also interested in a blog post about my journey into coding. You can read about that [here](https://www.enova.com/blog/3-life-lessons-i-learned-on-my-road-to-software-engineering/).
