### Welcome!
Welcome to the site! Thank you for visiting. My name is Gary Coffey. I created this site to showcase some of my favorite coding projects as well as to write various blogs. I figured I would use this page to talk about myself (career/hobbies/etc).

### Career

For this section, I don't want to add yet another resume that I will have to keep up to date. I just want to talk in general about the companies I have worked for and give a general overview of my positions/experiences.

I have a long career that includes software engineering *insert time once retired* and 7 years in the Air Force before that. I have enjoyed both experiences and am thankful for all opportunities.

**Software Engineering**

When I first started writing here, it quickly became it's own [blog post]().

**Air Force**

### Media Attention

I was recognized [here](https://www.codeplatoon.org/gary-coffey-and-karin-matsuyama-alumni-of-the-month-october-2019/) as the Code Platoon Member of the Month.

Shortly after graduating from Code Platoon, CBS news Chicago reached out interested in doing a news piece about under-employed veterans. You can see the full news post [here](https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2019/09/02/code-platoon-veterans-computer-coding/).

The company that I currently work for was also interested in a blog post about my journey into coding. You can read about that [here](https://www.enova.com/blog/3-life-lessons-i-learned-on-my-road-to-software-engineering/).

I was also contacted by a University student who was interested in writing a sotry about Karin and I. You can read about it [here](https://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/from-military-life-to-software-pro-a-chicago-coding-boot-camps-impact/).
