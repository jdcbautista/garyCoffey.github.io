### What technology was used
This site was built using Jekyll. I think this was perfect for what I wanted this site to  be. Just a small-scale site with just the minimum necassary. I like to always start small when building something new and wait to upgrade when/if it becomes neeeded. This was also the first site I built using Jekyll and it was fun to learn over a weekend.
