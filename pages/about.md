#### Hosting solution

This site is also hosted on Github using github-pages.

#### What technology was used

This site was built using Jekyll. I think this was perfect for what I wanted this site to  be. Just a small-scale site with just the minimum necessary. I like to always start small when building something new and wait to upgrade when/if it becomes needed. This was also the first site I built using Jekyll and it was fun to learn over a weekend.
